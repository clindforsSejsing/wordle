Make a game of wordle. 

1. Algorithm with the rules of the game. 
- The game chooses a word (of a list)
- The user guess what word it is by writing an input of the suggested word
-If the word is correct- the user wins. Otherwise the game gets feedback of what was correct, right placement etc. 
-The user gets to guess again until the word is correct.

Make two or moore tests to see that it works. Also make comments/documentation. 

Algoritm A: 
-defines the rules
- gives the user feedback

Algoritm B:
-How the game chooses words
