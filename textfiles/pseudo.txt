pseudocode:

//* Make a game of wordle:
/* 1. The game chose a word from a list and make the user know how many letters the word has. 
2. The user guesses by writing into an input, a word with the same amount of letters.
3. If the word is correct- user wins. 
4. Word not correct? Then teh game gives feedback: if the letter is correct, if the letter is correct but at the wrong spot in the word, or if the letter is not in the secret word. 
5. The input with the correct letters (and at the right place) should stay in place when the user gets more chanses to guess the word. 
6. The guesses have no limits. The user gets a notification when the correct word is guessed.

Make a game of wordle. (Break down the assignment) 

1. Algorithm with the rules of the game. 
- The game chooses a word (of a list)
- The user guess what word it is by writing an input of the suggested word
-If the word is correct- the user wins. Otherwise the game gets feedback of what was correct, right placement etc. 
-The user gets to guess again until the word is correct.

Make two or moore tests to see that it works. Also make comments/documentation. 

Algoritm A: 
-defines the rules
- gives the user feedback

Algoritm B:
-How the game chooses words
